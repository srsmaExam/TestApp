# Progress Log — Shri Ram Smart Minds Academy (Local Build)

Status snapshot of the local-first JEE Test Platform build. See
[JEE-Test-Platform-LLD.md](JEE-Test-Platform-LLD.md) for the production design
and [JEE-Test-Platform-Local-Build-Plan.md](JEE-Test-Platform-Local-Build-Plan.md)
for how the local edition maps to it.

## Key Technical Achievements & Architecture

1. **Answer-Key Leak Defense**:
   - `src/lib/dto.ts` is the single choke point shaping question payloads for students, projecting only safe student fields.
   - `src/lib/dto.leak.test.ts` recursively asserts that no key or value for `answer`, `solution`, `difficulty`, or `extractionNotes` can ever reach the student client bundle.
2. **Offline Resilience & Disconnect Protection**:
   - Student test state is mirrored to `idb-keyval` (IndexedDB) on every response change.
   - Debounced autosave (300ms) + 15s periodic heartbeat + `beforeunload` `navigator.sendBeacon` ensure zero lost answers.
   - Disconnect reconciliation allows completing tests even during full network drops.
3. **Pure Server-Side Grading Engine**:
   - `src/lib/grading.ts` cleanly scores MCQ options (case-insensitive key matching), numerical / integer values (parsing `"42.0" === 42`), and numerical tolerance ranges `{min, max}`.
   - One-transaction idempotent submit endpoint at `POST /api/attempts/:id/submit`.
4. **Interactive Analytics & Reporting**:
   - Direct integration with database views `v_question_stats` and `v_test_ranks`.
   - Recharts visual dashboards for student score trends and teacher score distribution histograms.
   - Instant CSV export endpoint for test leaderboards.
