# Shri Ram Smart Minds Academy — Local Build Quick Reference

This is the **local-first** edition of [JEE-Test-Platform-LLD.md](JEE-Test-Platform-LLD.md), described in [JEE-Test-Platform-Local-Build-Plan.md](JEE-Test-Platform-Local-Build-Plan.md). Everything — database, source PDFs, cropped images — lives under `data/` on this machine with zero cloud dependencies.

**Current Status:** All build stages (Stages 0–10) are complete and operational.

## 1. Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Install packages
npm install

# 2. Seed database (first time or after reset)
npm run seed

# 3. Start local development server
npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** in your browser.

## 3. How to Use

### As a Teacher:
1. **Digitize Paper**: Upload PDF at `/teacher/papers` → copy prompt at `/teacher/extraction-prompt` → run Gemini in browser → paste JSON into Ingest tab.
2. **Crop & Verify**: In Question Editor (`/teacher/questions/[id]`), drag crops on the PDF canvas for `[[IMG:...]]` placeholders, set answers, and click **Verify**.
3. **Build & Publish Test**: At `/teacher/tests/new`, configure duration and shuffle settings → in Test Builder (`/teacher/tests/[id]`), add questions from bank → click **Publish Test**.
4. **Analytics**: Inspect score distribution, candidate rankings, and item accuracy at `/teacher/tests/[id]/analytics` and download the CSV scorecard.

### As a Student:
1. **Take Exam**: At `/student`, click **Take Test** → agree to instructions → enter the CBT Test Runner (`/student/attempts/[id]`).
2. **Test Runner Controls**: Switch Physics/Chemistry/Maths tabs, select options, use **Save & Next** or **Mark for Review & Next**, navigate via the 75-cell palette.
3. **Disconnect Protection**: Answers are mirrored to IndexedDB locally; you can complete exams even during offline network interruptions.
4. **Review & Analytics**: After submission, inspect step-by-step KaTeX solutions at `/student/attempts/[id]/result` and track performance curves at `/student/analytics`.
