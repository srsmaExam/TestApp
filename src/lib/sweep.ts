/**
 * LLD §7.1: "Vercel Cron every 5 min auto-submits any in_progress attempt past
 * deadline, so an abandoned tab still gets graded." Locally this runs on a
 * 60s setInterval from client.ts instead of a cron route, plus
 * opportunistically whenever an attempt is read (added in stage 7) — so a
 * server restart can't leave a stale attempt un-swept for a full interval.
 *
 * This DOES grade. It previously only flipped `status` to 'auto_submitted' on
 * the theory that "the actual scoring transaction runs separately" — but
 * nothing ever ran it, and because submit short-circuits on an already-closed
 * attempt, a student who ran out of time was left permanently at 0/0 with
 * every answer discarded. Scoring now goes through the same
 * gradeAndCloseAttempt() the manual submit path uses, so both routes produce
 * an identically-shaped, fully-graded attempt and whichever fires first wins
 * harmlessly.
 *
 * Accepts an optional `db` handle so `client.ts`'s `initialise()` can pass its
 * own locally-constructed instance directly. That's not an optimisation — it's
 * required: `initialise()` awaits this function before its own `getDb()`
 * promise resolves, so falling back to the default `await getDb()` here would
 * re-enter that same still-pending promise and deadlock (a promise awaiting
 * its own resolution never settles — observed directly as a silent hang with
 * no error, since nothing else was left to keep the process alive).
